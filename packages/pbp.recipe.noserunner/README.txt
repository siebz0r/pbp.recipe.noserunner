QuickStart
**********

`pbp.recipe.noserunner` will let you create a `Nose` test runner script in 
your buildout. Here's an example of the simplest configuration::

    [buildout]
    parts = test

    [test]
    recipe = pbp.recipe.noserunner

If you run the builout, a `test` script will be created in the bin directory to
run your tests using Nose.
