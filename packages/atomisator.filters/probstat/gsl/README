This is a copy of code from the GNU Scientific Library
(http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/)

It was a reference for the 2nd generation of algos I
used in permutation & combination. (The first one
I wrote, they sucked).  It may still be the current
implemenation.

Use these, or download and read the gsl sources if
you want to know what is going on and my code isn't
commented well enough.
