CVS Only

0.912 (Oct 11, 2002)
    Admin : Welcome John Hunter! [JDH now with full sourceforge access(TM), this release is largely due to his contributions]
    * added combination_calculate_NK patch to CVS
    * combinations work for a wider range of cases, eg when sequence
      is longish but total number of combinations is not, as in
    * probstat.Combination(range(100), 2).  Added test to combo.py
    * similar fix for Permutations, and a test in test/permute.py

0.911 (no date)
    * patched to compile on windows
0.911 (Sep 13, 2002)
    * fixed, iterator over slices of permutations/combinations ignored the ending argument
0.910 (Sep 7, 2002)
    * objects can still be used as iterators, but ob.next() is gone
    * slices! p = probstat.Permutation(range(1,5), sub_p = p[3:5]
    * len! print 'len of permute is ', len(p)
    * Algorithms! we now use standard public domain algos, largely from gsl
    * Priority Queue added
    * ComboPermute is dead, you can now call permute with a choose argument, eg p = probstat.Permutation(range(1,5), 3)
0.901 (Aug 11, 2002)
    * returned objects can be used as iterators (ob.next() still works)
    * fixed typo so module init function matches module name
0.900 (Aug 8, 2002)
    * Initial release
