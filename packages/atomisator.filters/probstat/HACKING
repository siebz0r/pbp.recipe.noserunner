would like.

The algorithms are all from GPL'd or public domain source,
originals are under the gsl/ directory if I have them.

stats_module.h has a few #defines

BASETYPE is the kind of item you are going to return a list of
for the python bindings, this is PyObject *
BASETYPE_L defines an array of BASETYPE (PyObject **)
BASETYPE_LL is for a two-dimensional array of BASETYPE (PyObject ***)

submitted patches are copyright me and released under the GPL
I'm using GPL version 2, no future versions automatically apply

* none, 0.912 pushes CVS changes into the release

TODO
* Perl XS bindings!

I have some perl module wrappers that are compatible with Inline::C but
I haven't tested them thourougly, and they only have the basic functionality
(no slices, etc).  If you would like to improve them, or just use them
drop me an email.
