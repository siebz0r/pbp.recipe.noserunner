To make it compile under windows/cygwin I had to do the following:

- copy the windows python.exe to w98python.exe in order to dicriminate
between the cygwin python version and the windows python version.

- run w98python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32

- copy the probstat.pyd in the build directory to the python22\\dlls

If this doesn't work let me know.  Patches especially welcome.
