This recipe will help you setup a full-featured Trac instance via buildout.

It allows you to automate the creation and management of multiples Trac
instances. It provides sensible default to the ``trac.ini`` configuration file.
It also takes care of instance upgrades, Wiki documentation updates and source
code repository resynchronization.

It currently supports Trac 0.11.x only, as for all future release of
``pbp.recipe.trac`` v0.3.x. Support of Trac 0.12.x is planned for
``pbp.recipe.trac`` v0.4.

This package is part of the `Expert Python Programming` book written by Tarek
Ziad√©.
