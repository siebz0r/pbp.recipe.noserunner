This recipe will help you setup a full-featured Trac instance via buildout.

It allows you to automate the creation and management of multiples Trac
instances. It provides sensible default to the ``trac.ini`` configuration file
and adds plugins to increase Trac features. This recipe also takes care of
instance upgrades, Wiki documentation updates and source code repository
synchronization.

It currently supports Trac 0.12.x only, as for all future release of
``pbp.recipe.trac`` v0.4.x.

This package was originally part of the `Expert Python Programming` book written
by Tarek Ziad√©.
