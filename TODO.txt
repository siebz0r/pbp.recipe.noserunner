- add a simple helper for sources plugins to return the right structure (maybe provide a class)
- add filtering plugins feature : plugins are able to be used
  in a filter chain when an entry is retrieve. They have a view
  on the db and now how to cleanup or removed an entry.
- find a way to make the database filling pluggable as well (with atomisator.db as a default one)

urldiff needs to work with another plugin that tells
if the diff is pertinent
